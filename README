              NASM, the Netwide Assembler.

Many many developers all over the net respect NASM for what it is
- a widespread (thus netwide), portable (thus netwide!), very
flexible and mature assembler tool with support for many output
formats (thus netwide!!).

Now we have good news for you: NASM is licensed under LGPL.
This means its development is open to even wider society of
programmers wishing to improve their lovely assembler.

The NASM project is now situated at SourceForge.net, the most
famous Open Source development center on The Net.
