Bytecode specification
----------------------

These are the bytecodes generated by x86/insn.pl into x86/insnsb.c
and consumed by asm/assemble.c and disasm/disasm.c.

Values prefixed with \ are in octal, values prefixed with \x are in
hexadecimal.

The mnemonics are the ones used in x86/insns.txt, where applicable.

\171\mab         /mrb (e.g /3r0)         a ModRM, with the reg field taken from operand a, and the m
                                         and b fields set to the specified values.
\172\ab          /is4                    the register number from operand a in bits 7..4, with

\240..\243                               this instruction uses EVEX rather than REX or VEX/XOP, with the
                                         V register number taken from operand "b" (0..3) (which may

\250                                     this instruction uses EVEX rather than REX or VEX/XOP, with the
                                         V register number set to 0 (subject to the XOR as defined
					 below)

EVEX prefixes are followed by the sequence:

     \p1\p2\p3\3tt

		... which are XOR'd into the EVEX payload bytes. These are used to encode the
		map and other fixed fields. Note that the inverted register bits should be
		set to 1.

		These are used in conjunction with the following instruction flags:

		IF_LIG	hint to the disassembler: ignore EVEX.L
		IF_WIG	hint to the disassembler: ignore EVEX.W
		IF_WW	W is used as REX_W
		IF_NF	the {nf} prefix is permitted for this instruction
		IF_DFV	this instruction uses the V field as DFV

		tt is tuple type for Disp8*N from %tuple_codes in insns.pl
                   (compressed displacement encoding)

\327		 nw			     indicates that the operand size defaults to 64 in 64-bit mode;
					     REX.W is not required. As a side effect, 32-bit operand size is

					     following effects:
					     o16 - 66 prefix generated in 32- or 64-bit mode.
					     o32 - 66 prefix generated in 16-bit mode; treated as o64 in 64-bit mode.

					     is also generated, these are emitted as legacy prefix bytes.
